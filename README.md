# INSTRUCTIONS
<p>To use, download both the scraper and the sheets package. Save the package as <code>__init__.py</code> </p>
<p>In Pycharm, create a new package folder and name it <code>sheets</code>. Save the init package into the sheets folder and it should function as a package.
At the bottom of the program are path names for reference folders. These are required to detect combos and item categories. You will need to have a copy of these files and replace the path in the program to the path in your computer that contains the required files. You can also change the path and file name of the exported scraped spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Run the program to commence scraping. Enter the OPAL username and password when prompted. After scraping is done, a prompt will appear asking which warehouses should be included. Enter the corresponding number to access the chosen warehouse(s).</p>
